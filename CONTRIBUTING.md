# Contributing to Shella

Want to contribute to Shella? Great! We're always happy to have more contributors. Before you start developing, though, we ask that you read through this document in-full. It's full of tips and guidelines--if you skip it, you'll likely miss something important (and your pull request will probably be rejected as a result).

## Reporting Bugs

The [bug tracker](https://github.com/shella-client/issues) at Github is for reporting bugs in Jasper. If you encounter problems during installation or compilation of one of Shella's dependencies for example, do not create a new issue here.

If you think that you found a bug and that you're using the most recent version of Shella, please include a detailed description what you did and how to reproduce the bug. If Shella crashes, run it with `--debug` as command line argument and also include the full stacktrace (not just the last line). If you post output, put it into a [fenced code block](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks). Last but not least: have a look at [Simon Tatham's "How to Report Bugs Effectively"](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html) to learn how to write a good bug report.
